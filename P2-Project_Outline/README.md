# Project Outline
For this assignment, you will submit a high-level outline of your project. This can, and likely will, change over time. In particular, your mentor will provide direction and feedback to help sharpen your ideas. So don't worry if you feel unsure about some aspects of the outline or if you have to change some things later.

## Submission Instructions

### Overview
put elevator pitch here

### Features
Create Event: Users will be able to input information (Name, Date, Description, Location, Cost) which will be saved to our database.  
Edit Event: Users with authorization will be able to edit their event.
Search and Filter for Event: The user can search for specific key words or filters.
Display Events: The user will be able to view events according to their search (list) or location (map).
User Login and Authentication: Users will be able to create accounts (user or event creator) and log in to their type of account. Each user will have a profile page (list of events created or list of favorited events).  
Favorited Events: Event searchers will be able to save and view events to their profile (this is where we may implement notifications).

### Technologies
Java, Spring Boot, Hibernate, Thymeleaf?, MySQL, JavaScript, Angular

### What I'll Have to Learn
OAuth
Mapping - maybe Google Maps API
Event Authentication - to make sure "fake" events cannot be submitted
Notifications to User - we are not sure how/if this will be possible yet
More Angular
